<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Wycliffe-Mwebi/Data-science-portfolio-Projects-Using-Python/tree/master/Bank%20Customer%20Churn%20Analysis%20%26%20Prediction">Customer Survival Analysis and Churn Prediction</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="../customer.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Customer Churn, is the loss of clients or customers. Churn prediction consists of detecting which customers are likely to leave based on how they use the service.
Customer Churn rate is one of the key business metrics because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one.
In this project I have used survival analysis methods to see how the likelihood of the customer churn changes over time and to calculate expected customer LTV using survival curve. I have also implemented Random Forest to accurately predict the customer churn and deployed a model using flask.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Wycliffe-Mwebi/Data-science-portfolio-Projects-Using-Python/tree/master/Cryptocurrency%20Market%20Analysis">Cryptocurrency Market Analysis</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="../cryptocurrency.jpg" alt="">
In this project, I will analyze data from Yahoo Finance of three popular cryptocurrencies to date. I will use Pandas to extract and analyze the information, visualize it, and analyze risks based on it&rsquo;s performance history.
Here are questions I will try to answer:
What was the change of price over time?
What was the daily return on average of a stock?
What was the moving average of various stock?
What is the correlation between daily returns of different stock?
How much value do we put at risk by investing in a stock?
How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Wycliffe-Mwebi/Data-science-portfolio-Projects-Using-Python/tree/master/Customer%20Segmentation">Customer Segmentation</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="../market.jpg" alt="">
In this project, I will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.</p>

<p><img src="../investment.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>How does volatility impact returns?
I was talking with a friend who told me that, given 2 mutual funds with equal average interest rates, the one that has less volatility gets you more money in the long run. This is a Monte Carlo simulation to test that hypothesis.
I&rsquo;ll do a few tests:
Test 1: Does volatility of investments affect expected returns?
Test 2: Does volatility of investments affect the probability of reaching various financial goals?
Test 3: Is it better to invest in higher-risk things while young and go lower-risk when you get older?</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Wycliffe-Mwebi/Data-science-portfolio-Projects-Using-Python/tree/master/Loan-Default-Prediction">Loan Default Prediction</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="../loan.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In this project, My goal was to build a predictive model that can predict whether or not a loan will be fully paid or charged off (defaulted), in order to minimize the risks of loan defaults for the company. I also would like to find the most important factors in making decisions about lending.
I analyzed useful features and investigated the correlations among the features and between the features and the target variable. I used K-S tests to check whether the features have notably different distributions for the “fully paid” and “charged off” loans.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Wycliffe-Mwebi/Data-Science-Portfolio-Projects-in-R/tree/main/Health%20Survey%20Data%20Analysis">Health Survey Data Analysis</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="../health.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Surveys are often used to study health behavior and determine the risks of disease. Meanwhile, seemingly every day, news outlets publish a different &ldquo;research says&rdquo; article about how to lose weight (fast! with no effort at all!). In this project, I will use survey data of ~20k people sampled from the United States to explore health behaviors associated with lower Body Mass Index (BMI), a standardized measure of healthy weight and obesity.  The survey data is from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The NHANES data includes many measurements related to overall health, physical activity, diet, psychological health, socioeconomic factors and more.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Wycliffe-Mwebi/Data-Science-Portfolio-Projects-in-R/tree/main/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection">Credit card Fraud Detection</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="../creditcard.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Billions of dollars are lost every year due to fraudulent credit card transactions and data shows that credit card fraud is rising. Therefore there is an urgent need to develop new, and improve current, fraud detection methods. The design of efficient fraud detection algorithms is key to reducing these losses, and more algorithms rely on advanced machine learning techniques to assist fraud investigators. The objective of this project is to train a machine learning algorithm on a dataset to successfully predict fraudulent transactions. For this project I have used a dataset of European cardholders containing transactions made in the month of september 2013. The dataset is available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud">Kaggle</a></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Wycliffe-Mwebi/Data-Science-Portfolio-Projects-in-R/tree/main/Forecasting%20Food%20Prices%20in%20Rwanda">Forecasting Food Prices in Rwanda</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="../foodrwanda.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Every time I go to the supermarket, my wallet weeps a little. But how expensive is food around the world? In this project, I will explore time series of food prices in Rwanda from the United Nations Humanitarian Data Exchange Global Food Price Database. Agriculture makes up over 30% of Rwanda&rsquo;s economy, and over 60% of its export earnings (CIA World Factbook), so the price of food is very important to the livelihood of many Rwandans. In this project, I am going to import, manipulate, visualize and forecast Rwandan potato price data. I will also wrap my analysis into functions to make it easy to analyze prices of other foods.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Wycliffe-Mwebi/Data-Science-Portfolio-Projects-in-R/tree/main/Payday%20Loans%20and%20economic%20inequality">Payday Loans and economic inequality</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="../payday.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>A payday loan is a type of short-term borrowing where a lender will extend high interest credit based on a borrower’s income. In this script for the CFPB consumer complaint data, I am going to look at this somewhat contentious financial product: payday loans. My hypothesis is that consumers of payday loans exhibit a different behaviour with regards to complaining, due to their economic status and not necessarily because the providers are delivering substantially better service to this category of customers. First, loading up the packages and getting the data from the SQL file provided by Kaggle.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Wycliffe-Mwebi/Data-Science-Portfolio-Projects-in-R/tree/main/Predicting%20Poverty%20Levels">Predicting Poverty Levels</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="../poverty.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In order to reduce poverty, social inequalities and address the needs of small and vulnerable countries, we must identify which households have the highest need for social welfare assistance? We’re told that often the most needy won’t be able to provide the documentation required of formal applications, so in many ways those who need the most help are also those who are least likely to recieve it. In this project, I will develop a model to help identify individuals and households that have the greatest need of financial aid. The challenge here then is to use the other information we know about individuals and households - features such as their family size, home construction type and their access to adequate sanitation - to help identify those individuals most in need before it’s too late.</p>

						<p>As a data scientist, I like to maintain ties to the research community while working in the data science field.

<h2 id="research-projects">Research Projects</h2>
<p><strong><a href="">Disaster-Location-Mapping-And-Warning-System</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="../disaster.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The objective of this project is to build a location tagged early warning system, hosted as a web-application, for disasters by analysing the posts on social media sites like Twitter. For this purpose, the system continuously ingests data from social media sites like Twitter, processes it (i.e., using machine learning classification techniques), classifies it into one of the several categories (like damages, need food and resources, people stuck, casualties etc). We also use the geo tagged information from the tweets to identify the latitudes and longitudes on world map in real time. The volume of tweets originating from a particular region are analysed and if the number exceeds certain threshold then we predict a disaster, followed by notifying the relief teams and government about the location.</p>
<p><strong><a href="">Disaster prediction system using animal behavior -A Machine Learning predictive model</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="../animal.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The purpose of this research is to design a system which can  predict disaster/natural calamity or any environmental threat by observing the behavior of animals. The system will study the various animal behavior both psychological and physiological factors and the immediate causes/effects in environment. By feeding the machine learning models with various test and training data, the system will be able to predict the outcome of the disaster. The system keeps monitoring various places and the animal behavior in the region. When the behavior of an animal/group of animals differ the normal behavior test data and it reaches a warning threshold, then the system warns the authorities of a possible natural calamity that is expected to happen in the region.</p>
<p><strong><a href="">Digital agriculture: Making the most of machine learning in Agriculture.</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="../agriculture.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The ability of agricultural equipment to think, predict and advise farmers via a variety of artificial intelligence (AI) applications presents Africa with the potential to achieve food security.
In this research, I explore various machine learning applications that can help farmers to increase yield, meet the ever-growing demand for agricultural products, and save the environment.</p>
